Gouda is a .NET wrapper for the Ghostscript C API. Ghostscript is a popular Postscript interpreter and image renderer used to display, convert, and print Postscript and PDF files. This will allow access to Ghostscript without the need to shell out to gswin32c.exe. It will also allow you to create and use custom output devices for Ghostscript.

The Ghostscript version that the wrapper is based on is GPL 8.60. Please check the Ghostscript Home Page to obtain the latest version.

Please note:
Although the wrapper code is offered under the MIT license (completely unrestricted) the Ghostscript is under GPL. This prevents use within commerical applications without a commerical license. However, if you have a valid commercial license for Ghostscript, you may use the wrapper code to access it from your commerical application with no licensing concerns.
