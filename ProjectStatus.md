## Current Status ##

Gouda is not yet to a first release.

If you are interested in working on the code, feel free to get the latest version, make your changes, and send a patch in. If you want to do a lot of work on the project, drop a line to thoward37@gmail.com, and I'll set you up with commit access to the repository. A quick note indicating what you want to work on would be helpful, so we don't step each other's toes.
